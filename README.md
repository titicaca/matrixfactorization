# matrixfactorization

In this project, we design and implement a strategy to parallelize the algorithm "matrix factorization with alternative least square" for recommendation system on stratosphere platform.  (Stratosphere developed, and contributes to a platform that recently became an Apache Incubator project under the name Apache Flink and is undergoing the incubation process. )

Our implementation shows a much better scalable performance comparing to Mahout implementation.
